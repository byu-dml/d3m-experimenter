Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition and Applications, in press. 2013.     \n\n### Description\n\nOne-hundred plant species leaves dataset (Class = Margin).The original data directory contains the binary images (masks) of the leaf samples (colour images not included).\nThere are three features for each image: Shape, Margin and Texture.\nFor each feature, a 64 element vector is given per leaf sample.\nThese vectors are taken as a contiguous descriptor (for shape) or histograms (for texture and margin).\nSo, there are three different files, one for each feature problem:  \n * 'data_Sha_64.txt' -> prediction based on shape\n * 'data_Tex_64.txt' -> prediction based on texture\n * 'data_Mar_64.txt' -> prediction based on margin [**dataset provided here**] \n\nEach row has a 64-element feature vector followed by the Class label.\nThere is a total of 1600 samples with 16 samples per leaf class (100 classes), and no missing values.\n\n### Attributes Information\n\nThree 64 element feature vectors per sample.\n",
