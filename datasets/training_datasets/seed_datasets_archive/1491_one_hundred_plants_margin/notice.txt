ID: 1491_one_hundred_plants_margin
Name: 1491_one_hundred_plants_margin_dataset
Description: Plant Leaf Classification Using Probabilistic Integration of Shape, Texture and Margin Features. Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition and Applications, in press. 2013.     

### Description

One-hundred plant species leaves dataset (Class = Margin).The original data directory contains the binary images (masks) of the leaf samples (colour images not included).
There are three features for each image: Shape, Margin and Texture.
For each feature, a 64 element vector is given per leaf sample.
These vectors are taken as a contiguous descriptor (for shape) or histograms (for texture and margin).
So, there are three different files, one for each feature problem:  
 * 'data_Sha_64.txt' -> prediction based on shape
 * 'data_Tex_64.txt' -> prediction based on texture
 * 'data_Mar_64.txt' -> prediction based on margin [**dataset provided here**] 

Each row has a 64-element feature vector followed by the Class label.
There is a total of 1600 samples with 16 samples per leaf class (100 classes), and no missing values.

### Attributes Information

Three 64 element feature vectors per sample.
